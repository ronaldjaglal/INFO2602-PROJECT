# INFO2602-PROJECT
Description of app:
On the app, the user would have a section for their grocery list and another to view recipes.
(the app would allow the user to search and browse through a list of recipes.) If the user likes a
recipe and wants to try it, they can add it to their recipe list. The app would then compare the ingredients 
in the users grocery list to the ingredients for that recipe. The ingredients that are not already in the grocery 
list would then be displayed to the user.
The user would then decide if they want to add it to their grocery list or not and continue to the next item.
